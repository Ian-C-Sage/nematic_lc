# nematic_lc
Programs relating to the deformation of an aligned nematic liquid crystal layer, under the influence of an applied electric field.

The project is primarily educational, covering both the liquid crystal physics and tyical or simplified algorithms suitable for the solution of the equations. Key steps in the analysis include:
- approximation of LC elastic behaviour by a torsional analogue of Hooke's law
- derivation of an expression for the free energy of deformation as a sum of splay, twist and bend terms
- application of the calculus of variations to find an expression for a minimal energy functional/equilibrium configuration of the LC director
- simplification of the full CoV expression for cases of isotropic elastic constants, zero field etc.
- algorithms for solution of the director configuration for teh special cases where a linear equation results
- pragmatic routines for solution of the general case
The routines are intended to provide insight into LC behaviour; some of the later programs may be of practical value in situations of practical importance.
